Editor Spec 1.0 — SCADFriend Requirements
===========================================

### 1. Fix: Remove extra empty div below the tab bar

The last commit introduced an unnecessary white div beneath the tab toolbar
that wastes vertical space. Clean up the sizing approach — consider CSS Grid
with grid-template-rows (auto for tab bar, 1fr for editor) instead of mixed
JS-computed sizes and vh units. Audit all inline styles, style-props-html,
and @emotion/react styles to ensure nothing breaks.

### 2. Feature: Extension-based syntax highlighting + binary file detection

- Create a dedicated file mapping extensions to Monaco language IDs (install
  additional Monaco language packages if needed).
- Any file whose extension is NOT in that map is treated as a binary file.
- When a binary file tab is active, show a placeholder div instead of Monaco
  displaying: the file name, "Binary file", and an inferred file type label
  (e.g., "Image", "Video", "Arbitrary binary" — hardcoded lookup).
- Future: special viewers for images/video/etc., but not now.

### 3. Feature: Disable render buttons for non-.scad files

When the active tab is NOT a .scad file (case-insensitive), disable both
"Render (Manifold)" and "Render (CGAL)" buttons since rendering only applies
to OpenSCAD files.

### 4. Feature: Show last-rendered file info in the viewer pane

In the right-side viewer pane, display a small indicator showing:
- Which file was last rendered
- Which backend was used (Manifold or CGAL)

Add new fields to WorkspaceState and corresponding React state, following
existing persistence conventions (debounced IndexedDB writes).

### 5. Feature: Persist last-rendered model and camera state to IndexedDB

- In-memory (always): The app keeps the last-rendered file name, backend,
  model data, and camera/orbit state in React state as normal — no size
  restrictions.
- IndexedDB persistence (all-or-nothing): Persist the last-rendered model
  data, file name, backend, and camera/OrbitControls state to IndexedDB so
  the full 3D view can be restored on reload. However, if the model data
  exceeds a configurable size limit (default: 100 MB, defined as a named
  variable in its own file), skip persisting ALL of it — model, filename,
  backend, and camera state alike — to avoid a desync between what is stored.
- Camera & OrbitControls state: Research whether Three.js camera
  position/rotation/zoom and OrbitControls target are serializable and
  restorable. If so, include them in the persisted bundle.
